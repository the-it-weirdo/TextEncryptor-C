choose the last element in the array as the pivot element. Assume that the input is a permutation of {1,
2, …, n}. Which of the following would be a worst case permutation of this input for this implementation
of quicksort?

9) Which of the following statements is not true?
For every fixed strategy to choose a pivot for quicksort, we can construct a worst case input that
requires time O(n2).
If we randomly choose a pivot element each time, quicksort will always terminate in time O(n log n).
